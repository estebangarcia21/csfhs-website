Tables and laptops have replaced the rows of desktops to give students more opportunities to collaborate and work together. Each group has a TV screen to make it easier to see the teacher's notes and allow students to project their own screens from their laptops. The walls now have large whiteboards to provide students with more opportunities to problem solve and plan out their projects.",
